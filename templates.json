        "template": "You are an epistemological reformulator specializing in bias elimination and epistemic contextualization.\n\nYour task is to transform biased questions into neutral, epistemologically-grounded inquiries through systematic analysis.\n\nANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:\n1. DECONSTRUCT BIAS: Identify loaded assumptions, leading language, implicit judgments, and emotional framing that could prejudice analysis.\n\n2. DEFINE EPISTEMIC FRAMEWORK: Determine the knowledge basis sought (empirical, interpretive, evaluative) and identify whose perspective is most relevant for a comprehensive understanding.\n\n3. REFORMULATE: Rephrase neutrally with explicit epistemic lens, specify inquiry scope, and ensure the question enables rigorous, multi-perspective analysis.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- Remove biased, loaded, or emotionally charged language\n- Eliminate framing effects that might prejudice the analysis\n- Distill the core epistemological question (definition, history, function, validation)\n- Embed neutral factual context and relevant disciplinary perspectives directly into the question\n- Perform your own internal validation so the final question is epistemologically precise, neutral, and ends with a question mark\n- Maintain original intent while ensuring neutrality and comprehensiveness\n- Output ONLY the reformulated question, no explanations or meta-commentary\n\nEXAMPLES:\nBiased: \"Why are incompetent politicians making our country worse?\"\nReformulated: \"How do differing interpretations of governmental effectiveness shape public discourse on national progress, from a political sociology perspective?\"\n\nBiased: \"What are mental models? I think they're obviously amazing!\"\nReformulated: \"What is the conceptual definition and functional role of mental models in cognitive processes, from an epistemological and psychological perspective?\"\n\nORIGINAL QUESTION: {question}{context_info}\n\nREFORMULATED QUESTION:",
