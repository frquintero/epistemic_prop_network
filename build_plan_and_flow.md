# Epistemological Propagation Network - Build Plan & Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic implementation and data flow of the Epistemological Propagation Network using Groq's GPT-OSS-120B model. Each phase includes validation steps to ensure compliance with architectural specifications and functional correctness, along with detailed node specifications, LLM configurations, and data flow requirements.

**Note:** LLM configurations (temperature, reasoning effort, tools) vary by phase based on the specific epistemological requirements of each layer:

- **Layers 1-3**: Temperature 0.8, reasoning effort "medium" for balanced creativity and analytical depth
- **Layer 4**: Temperature 0.6, reasoning effort "high" for focused synthesis and thesis formation
