# Epistemological Propagation Network: Complete Description for Implementation

This document describes a strict feed-forward propagation network for epistemological inquiry. The network processes a user's question through four layers, each with specific nodes and functions, to produce a holistic, narrative-driven answer with a thesis. The model ensures rigor, avoids bias, and delivers value by integrating definition, history, function, and validation into a coherent story.

## Network Overview

- **Layers:** 4 layers (Layer 1 to Layer 4)
- **Flow:** Strictly feed-forward; outputs of one layer are exclusively inputs for the next.
- **Connectivity:** 
  - Layer 1 output → Input to all Layer 2 nodes
  - Layer 2 output → Input to all Layer 3 nodes
  - Layer 3 output → Input to Layer 4 node
- **Final Output:** A comprehensive answer from Layer 4, including a narrative and thesis.

## Layer 1: Input Reformulation

- **Purpose:** To purify and contextualize the raw user question, ensuring it is unbiased, coherent, and ready for processing.
- **Node:** `Reformulator`
- **Input:** Raw user question (e.g., "What are mental models?")
- **Processing:**
  - **Bias Elimination:** Identifies and neutralizes loaded language, assumptions, or framing effects.
  - **Essence Checking:** Distills the question to its core epistemological intent (e.g., definition, history, function).
  - **Context Addition:** Appends neutral, factual context without providing answers (e.g., disciplines where the concept is used).
- **Output:** A reformulated question that is precise and context-aware.
  - **Example Output:** "Provide a comprehensive epistemological account of the concept 'mental models', including its semantic definition, historical origin, and primary functions, acknowledging its use across cognitive psychology, philosophy, and systems engineering."

## Layer 2: Definition Generation

- **Purpose:** To generate a multi-faceted conceptual framework by defining the concept from three perspectives.
- **Nodes:** Three parallel nodes (each processes the same input from Layer 1 independently):
  - `Semantic Node`
  - `Genealogical Node`
  - `Teleological Node`
- **Input:** Reformulated question from Layer 1.
- **Processing:**
  - **Semantic Node:** Focuses on language, etymology, common usage, and logical structure. Outputs a strict definition (`O_s`).
    - **Example Output (`O_s`):** "A mental model is an internal, simplified cognitive representation of an external system or process, used for understanding, reasoning, and prediction."
  - **Genealogical Node:** Focuses on historical origin and evolution. Outputs a historical account (`O_g`).
    - **Example Output (`O_g`):** "The concept was formally introduced by Kenneth Craik in 1943, expanded by Philip Johnson-Laird in human reasoning, and popularized in decision-making by Charlie Munger."
  - **Teleological Node:** Focuses on purpose and utility. Outputs a functional account (`O_t`).
    - **Example Output (`O_t`):** "The primary function of mental models is to allow individuals to simulate outcomes, form explanations, and make decisions efficiently without direct experience, thus navigating complexity."
- **Output:** The triple `{O_s, O_g, O_t}`. This composite output is passed to all nodes in Layer 3.

## Layer 3: Validation

- **Purpose:** To stress-test the conceptual framework from Layer 2 through empirical, logical, and pragmatic validation.
- **Nodes:** Three validator nodes (each receives the entire triple `{O_s, O_g, O_t}` from Layer 2):
  - `Correspondence Validator`
  - `Coherence Validator`
  - `Pragmatic Validator`
- **Input:** The triple `{O_s, O_g, O_t}` from Layer 2.
- **Processing:**
  - **Correspondence Validator:** Tests empirical alignment with observable reality. Checks if `O_s` corresponds to evidence (e.g., from neuroscience), if `O_g` aligns with historical records, and if `O_t` matches practical use. Outputs a verdict `V_c` that includes validated aspects with empirical support.
    - **Example Output (`V_c`):** "The definition `O_s` is empirically supported by brain imaging studies showing internal representations. The history `O_g` is accurate per scientific literature. The function `O_t` is observed in decision-making studies."
  - **Coherence Validator:** Tests internal and external logical consistency. Checks if `O_s` is internally consistent, if `O_g` logically leads to `O_s`, and if `O_t` coheres with established knowledge (e.g., theories of learning). Outputs a verdict `V_l` with coherence assessments.
    - **Example Output (`V_l`):** "The definition `O_s` is logically consistent. The history `O_g` coherently explains the concept's development. The function `O_t` aligns with cognitive theories and is a logical extension of `O_s`."
  - **Pragmatic Validator:** Tests practical utility and application. Evaluates how useful `O_s`, `O_g`, and `O_t` are in real-world scenarios (e.g., business, education). Outputs a verdict `V_p` with utility assessments.
    - **Example Output (`V_p`):** "The concept is highly useful: `O_s` aids in designing experiments, `O_g` helps avoid past mistakes, and `O_t` provides a framework for improving decision-making in practice."
- **Output:** The triple `{V_c, V_l, V_p}`. Each verdict contains the relevant parts of `O_s`, `O_g`, `O_t` along with validation results. This output is passed to Layer 4.

## Layer 4: Synthesis & Communication

- **Purpose:** To integrate the validated insights into a holistic narrative that provides meaning, context, and value, culminating in a thesis.
- **Node:** `Synthesis Node`
- **Input:** The triple `{V_c, V_l, V_p}` from Layer 3.
- **Processing:**
  - **Integration:** Weaves together the definition (`O_s` from `V_c`), history (`O_g` from `V_l`), function (`O_t` from `V_p`), and validation results (`V_c`, `V_l`, `V_p`) into a single narrative.
  - **Narrative Building:** Creates a "story" that:
    - Provides context: Explains how the concept evolved and relates to broader disciplines.
    - Creates connection: Shows interrelationships between definition, history, and function.
    - Adds value: Offers practical insights, knowledge, skills, or inspiration.
  - **Thesis Formation:** Generates a concise thesis statement that encapsulates the core insight or takeaway.
  - **Output Structuring:** Organizes the answer logically, starting with definition, moving to history and function, discussing validation, and ending with the thesis.
- **Output:** A comprehensive, nuanced answer that includes:
  - A narrative with meaning, connection, and context.
  - Validation-based qualifications (e.g., limitations, strengths).
  - A thesis statement.
  - Value for the user (e.g., actionable knowledge, inspiration).

**Example Output for "What are mental models?"**
"Mental models are cognitive tools that simplify complexity, allowing us to navigate the world. Their story begins with Kenneth Craik in 1943, who proposed that the mind builds 'small-scale models' of reality to predict events. This idea was expanded by psychologists like Philip Johnson-Laird and popularized in decision-making by Charlie Munger, showing how models like 'supply and demand' or 'confirmation bias' serve practical functions for reasoning and choice.

Empirically, neuroscience supports that our brains form such representations (correspondence), and logically, these models cohere with theories of learning and memory (coherence). Pragmatically, they are invaluable for improving decisions, fostering innovation, and avoiding errors (utility). However, they are limited by their simplifications and require constant updating.

**Thesis:** Ultimately, mental models are indispensable yet imperfect frameworks that shape our understanding, and mastering their use is key to adaptive thinking in a complex world."

## Implementation Notes

- **Modular Design:** Implement each layer as a separate module or function. Each node within a layer can be a sub-function.
- **Data Passing:** Ensure outputs from one layer are correctly formatted and passed as inputs to the next layer.
- **Error Handling:** Include checks for invalid inputs or processing errors at each layer.
- **Customization:** The network can be adapted for various epistemological questions by adjusting the context and validation criteria.

This network provides a systematic approach to generating epistemologically sound answers. For implementation, you can use programming languages like Python, with dictionaries or objects to pass the triples between layers.
