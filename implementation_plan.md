# Implementation Plan for Epistemological Propagation Network

To implement the Epistemological Propagation Network using the groq
gpt-oss-120b model, we can follow a modular and systematic approach.
Here's the plan:

## 1. Setup and Configuration

- Ensure the GROQ_API_KEY is correctly set in the environment
  (already confirmed).
- Install and configure the necessary libraries to interact with the
  Groq API for making LLM calls.

## 2. Layer Implementation

Each layer will be implemented as a Python module or function, with
nodes corresponding to individual LLM calls. Outputs from one layer
will be formatted and passed as inputs to the next layer.

### Layer 1: Input Reformulation

- **Node:** `Reformulator`
- **Implementation:**
  - Accept raw user input.
  - Make an LLM call (with a carefully engineered prompt) to purify,
    contextualize, and reformulate the question in a single step.
  - Apply lightweight local validation before returning the reformulated question.

### Layer 2: Definition Generation

- **Nodes:** `Semantic Node`, `Genealogical Node`, `Teleological Node`
- **Implementation:**
  - Each node independently processes the reformulated question.
  - Make three parallel LLM calls to generate:
    - Semantic definition (`O_s`)
    - Historical account (`O_g`)
    - Functional account (`O_t`)
  - Output: Triple `{O_s, O_g, O_t}`.

### Layer 3: Validation

- **Nodes:** `Correspondence Validator`, `Coherence Validator`,
  `Pragmatic Validator`
- **Implementation:**
  - Each node receives the triple `{O_s, O_g, O_t}`.
  - Make three parallel LLM calls to validate:
    - Empirical alignment (`V_c`)
    - Logical consistency (`V_l`)
    - Practical utility (`V_p`)
  - Output: Triple `{V_c, V_l, V_p}`.

### Layer 4: Synthesis & Communication

- **Node:** `Synthesis Node`
- **Implementation:**
  - Integrate the validated outputs `{V_c, V_l, V_p}`.
  - Make an LLM call to generate a holistic narrative and thesis.
  - Output: Final answer with narrative, validation-based
    qualifications, and thesis.

## 3. Data Flow and Error Handling

- Ensure outputs from each node are correctly formatted for the next
  node.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs or API call failures.

## 4. Testing and Validation

- Test each layer independently with sample inputs.
- Validate the end-to-end flow with various epistemological questions.

## 5. Deployment

- Package the implementation as a Python application.
- Provide a CLI or web interface for user interaction.
