# Software Architecture Patterns You Must Know About

Software architecture styles are foundational blueprints that provide high-level structures for organizing code and components within a software system, defining how modules and layers interact. Popular styles include Layered, Client-Server, Event-Driven, Microkernel, Microservices, Service-Oriented (SOA), and Pipes and Filters architectures, each offering unique approaches to achieve qualities like scalability, maintainability, and performance by structuring the system's components and their relationships.

## Key Software Architecture Styles

### Layered Architecture

Organizes software into horizontal layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access, promoting separation of concerns and modularity.

### Client-Server Architecture

A distributed structure where clients request services from a centralized server, which processes the request and returns a response.

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

Focuses on the production, consumption, and reaction to events, enabling highly agile and performant systems for real-time applications.

### Microkernel Architecture

Consists of a minimal core system with plug-in modules that can be added or removed to extend functionality, providing high extensibility.

### Microservices Architecture

Breaks a large application into small, independent, and loosely coupled services, offering flexibility, scalability, and resilience compared to monolithic approaches.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Designs systems as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate with each other, providing a framework for building distributed systems.

### Pipes and Filters Architecture

Organizes system components as a sequence of filters, where data flows through a series of processing steps (pipes) to produce a final output.

### Blackboard Architecture

Involves a central shared "blackboard" where different knowledge sources or modules contribute to solving a problem, often used in artificial intelligence.

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

Decouples core application logic from external technologies by using ports and adapters, allowing for greater adaptability to new technologies.

## How Architecture Styles Are Used

### Structural Organization

Styles define how modules, layers, and components are organized and interact within a system.

### Reusable Blueprints

They provide reusable architectural solutions for common problems, ensuring consistency and efficiency in development.

### Quality Attribute Achievement

By applying these styles, architects can achieve desired system qualities, such as improved scalability, maintainability, performance, and reliability.

### Context-Dependent Choice

The selection of an architecture style depends on specific project requirements, constraints, and the nature of the application being built.
